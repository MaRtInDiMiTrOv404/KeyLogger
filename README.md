Information about the Keylogger Library:

Purpose: This library is designed to capture keystrokes from the keyboard and log them to a file.
Implementation: It uses a global keyboard hook to capture keystrokes. When a key is pressed, it's logged to the specified log file.
Usage: To use the library, instantiate the Keylogger class with the desired log file path. It will automatically start logging keystrokes once initialized.
Ethical Considerations: Keyloggers can be used for legitimate purposes such as monitoring computer usage for parental control or employee monitoring, but they can also be used for malicious intent. It's important to use such tools responsibly and ethically, and only on systems where you have explicit permission to do so.
Security: Using keyloggers can raise privacy and security concerns. Ensure that the log files are stored securely and are only accessible by authorized individuals.
